[{"title":"Church History","body_content":"Rivermont Baptist Church began with humble beginnings under the name of The Peoples Gospel Tabernacle in April 1954. Our founding pastor was Reverend Grover Klink and was followed by Reverend C.E. Blankenship in 1956. \n\n![](https://dl.airtable.com/oJvuIRTRcO9Te7sekKLw_full_DHoYebUVQKiviT427iMp_full_2016-09-21%2011.47.17.png)\n\nIn 1956 The Peoples Gospel Tabernacle was renamed Rivermont Baptist Church. After enlarging the original church building twice, Rivermont broke ground for a new building in 1963.\n\n![](https://dl.airtable.com/kHQGpO1cRpyBU59KUbbr_full_rev.%20blankenship0002.jpg)\n\n Jerry Young became pastor in 1965 and faithfully preached God’s word until his retirement in 2008. In honor of Pastor Young’s faithful ministry, we have named our fellowship hall in his honor.\n\n![](https://dl.airtable.com/Z9GrdpwtRu0caX7UIP4Q_full_home%20cming.jpg)\n\n In 2008 Seth Alcorn became pastor where he continues to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. \n\nOver the past 62 years Rivermont has become a steady congregation of faithful believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. We are excited to see what God has in store for us in our future!","featured_image":[{"id":"attoKevePFMQKgv6w","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/1LjUJ1fQaKTDd00G98hw_2016-09-21%2011.45.33.png","filename":"2016-09-21 11.45.33.png","size":1032457,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/uZsiMRZDTli8oItIvOGJ_small_2016-09-21%2011.45.33.png","width":76,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/tdSw2LZUTDWOSTRXqOCs_large_2016-09-21%2011.45.33.png","width":512,"height":512}}}],"published":true,"other_images":[{"id":"att2MmFY5R4VSiUVV","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/bZyh0JpiSha2vyh69EzL_DHoYebUVQKiviT427iMp_full_2016-09-21%2011.47.17.png","filename":"DHoYebUVQKiviT427iMp_full_2016-09-21 11.47.17.png","size":325461,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/GxYajUXjSMajGolyDfpP_small_DHoYebUVQKiviT427iMp_full_2016-09-21%2011.47.17.png","width":21,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/0UVmaibShuQoHuo89Vgw_large_DHoYebUVQKiviT427iMp_full_2016-09-21%2011.47.17.png","width":480,"height":512}}},{"id":"attTxarcUDSUqdc1l","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/zy5KBxiRT68vy9MZX88C_rev.%20blankenship0002.jpg","filename":"rev. blankenship0002.jpg","size":73750,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/H72jq9Q2QHuzooVhkJC2_small_rev.%20blankenship0002.jpg","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/LDWAMZaSquJekLfnkLLw_large_rev.%20blankenship0002.jpg","width":512,"height":512}}},{"id":"attHAt5bwPfWMdyp8","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/Q7n7AqMDSUqt0qn69ECd_home%20cming.jpg","filename":"home cming.jpg","size":161547,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/EHMZhLKTJKbXoiLAo9WU_small_home%20cming.jpg","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/cj03RcSxSHKhu1spjViA_large_home%20cming.jpg","width":512,"height":512}}}]}]
