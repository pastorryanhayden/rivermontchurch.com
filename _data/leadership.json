[{"Leader_Name":"Seth Alcorn","Content":"Seth grew up in a Christian home in Eden, NC, and heard the Gospel from the earliest of ages. It was not until he was eighteen years old that God began to deal with him about his eternal salvation, and a year later he repented of his sin and by faith accepted the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  After God’s miraculous work of conversion within him he surrendered to the call to preach the Gospel.  It was in Bible college where Seth met the love of his life Julie. They have been married since 2005 and have two children, Levi and Molly. Seth enjoys spending time with his family, preaching expositionaly through the Scriptures, and reading. He also enjoys watching the Washington Nationals and the Duke Men’s college Basketball teams. He  currently holds  a Master of Ministry degree and is working on a Master of Divinity degree from Shepherd’s Theological Seminary in Cary, NC.
