<!-- This welcome page is a little bit more complicated than the one on California.  It too has a banded design, but it uses a single page menu.  

Here is how it works -there are three elements to it:

First, the welcome_Menu.
    This is the menu for this page that sticks to the top of the screen as you scroll down.  It's pretty cool.  Instead of a URL in the <a href=""> part, put the symbol # and then the ID of the div section.  So if it is <div id="section-1"></div>  You would link to that with <a href="#section-1"></a>.
Second, the div sections:
    Each band or section of the page sits in a <div> tag.  This tag has to have two extra elements: an "ID" and a "data-magellan-target".  So the section-1 section would sit in a div that looks like this: <div class="section-1" id="section-1" data-magellan-target="section-1">
